            <p>
                From courtroom to canvas to literature, Evelyn enjoys analyzing the structure, design, and pattern of seemingly ordinary things; what makes one idea or presentation more appealing than another.
                
                Her specialty is discovering what users truly want and need through user research, especially if the user’s problems stem from structural issues and could be resolved with a more intuitive path for the user to take. Evelyn’s skills include, but aren’t limited to, using Figma, thinking outside-the-box, analyzing, and effectively interviewing potential users.

                <h3>Wireframing And Prototyping In Figma</h3>
                <p>Evelyn is capable of whipping together wireframes from low to high-fidelity. She can create prototypes with various levels of  intricacy, making them as interactive as the front-end-developer(s) would need them to be in order to make her designs a reality. She is flexible in this sense and can create iterations based-off usability testing conducted/provided.</p>

                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                <p>The key to a team’s success lies in their collaboration. Each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, but together, they can all create a strong and reliable team. Evelyn values collaboration and works to ensure a safe space with whomever she is collaborating with, so they feel comfortable sharing their ideas, no matter how developed they are. This approach helps generate unique and useful solutions to user problems and interface issues. </p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Evelyn has an affinity and ability to create objectives for any given project, lines of questioning for interviews as she was captain of her Mock Trial team in high school, to create personas, conduct user interviews, and organize information into useful chunks for further iteration. She is able to filter and organize gathered data into comprehensive diagrams that help further characterize the user personas, and in turn, create a sturdier basis from which the site/app development begins.</p>
